# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is an analysis approach to identify patterns, features, and outliers in data. It is the first step of dealing with data. EDA is not a formal process but rather an art dependent on the problem at hand. In simple terms, it is all about asking questions (a lot of them) and understanding the data through the application of a variety of techniques.  

In this blog post, I will explain my strategy for EDA, specifically how I approach it, and the things I try to look for.

## Overall Goal
My overall goal during any EDA is to understand the data at hand. The process helps me see patterns in data, identify outliers and data gaps, correlate variables, and generate interesting questions.

## Data Context
Prior to any exploratory analysis, I try to understand the context of the data. This helps me formulate relevant questions and the primary purpose of the analysis. I talk to the team that collected the data and ask some simple questions:  
  + purpose of the study/ research
  + data collection method (to identify biases)
  + variables of interest (if any)
