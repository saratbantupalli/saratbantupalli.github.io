##Life of a Data Scientist vs. Statistician

Everyone is a data scientist!! Humans have been using data to make sense of the world around us for a long time, may it be analyzing data in a cave to invent new hand tools or building a rocket to Mars. The newest generation of data scientists uses computers to make sense of data and make decisions.

A data scientist in general develops tools to analyze and synthesize the vast amounts of data being collected. The problem could be anything related to the environment, a product, or a service, becoming a data scientist is all about applying mathematical and statistical principles with the help of technology. A solid background in programming (R, Python, SQL/ databases) and Statistics is a recipe for excelling in the field.

A data scientist collects, analyses, and interprets data to draw meaningful conclusions. They perform analysis of raw data, study data, design data modeling processes, and create algorithms to find and analyze data. Knowledge in the fields of software engineering, machine learning, problem-solving, and a decent background in statistics are the key areas a data scientist needs to know.

While there is a lot of overlap between the roles of data scientists and statisticians, there are some key differences too. A data scientist position is more technology-oriented (eg. machine learning) while a statistician focuses more on mathematical concepts (eg. hypothesis testing). Data scientists have a more exploratory approach to data while statisticians have a more scientific approach (hypothesis-driven) to data. The focus for a data scientist is to solve real-life problems while a statistician focuses on model development and studying the underlying random variables. Data scientists in general work with large complex datasets.

As a Masters in Statistics student at NC State, I want to apply my knowledge of statistics to improve climate models. I want to use the principles of big data and apply statistical techniques to develop models, more in line with a Statistician.
