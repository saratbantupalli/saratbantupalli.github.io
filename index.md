# About

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub blog. I created this blog as part of my *Master's in Statistics* coursework at *NC State University*. I plan on using this blog to *showcase the projects* I have worked on in grad school.

## Education and Professional Life

I received my *Master's in Environmental Engineering* from NC State University in *2016*. Since then I have been working as a contractor to the United States Environmental Agency (US EPA) in Durham, North Carolina. I conduct research in air quality and my fields of interest are low-cost air quality sensors, statistical analysis of air quality data, and climate models. 

## Hobbies 

I have a dog, who adopted me five years ago. We love to go on hikes, dog parks and spend our weekends together. Here is a picture of my dog **Maya** :

We have a bucket list of places we want to travel together:  
  + Yellowstone National Park
  + Yosemite National Park
  + Crater Lake

In addition, I also play cricket in my free time and I love to cook.
